## Warm Up (5 mins)

ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5). Choose one of these to explain

- How do Web Pages work?
- How do web browsers work?
- What are Web APIs?

<!-- > -->
## What makes the web work? 

REST 😴 and SOAP 🧼

These are two different approaches to online data transmission. These describe how data is passed around over the internet. 

<!-- > -->

### SOAP 🧼

Simple Object Access Protcol 

is the official standard maintained by the W3C. 

<!-- > -->

### REST 😴

Representational State Transfer 

is an architectural 🏛 principal and guidelines <br> for creating public APIs.

<!-- > -->

### REST 😴 vs SOAP 🧼

SOAP is the orignal protocol and is officially maintained by the the W3C. SOAP relies on XML exclusively. 

<small>(which is why it's not as widely used)</small>

<!-- > -->

REST on the other hand is simpler to use and is open to any data format so it works with JSON. This makes it a popular for APIs that rely on JSON. 

<small>(Works with JSON and is open)</small>

<!-- > -->

## What is REST? 😴

Before we look at GraphQL lets take a look at REST. 

This is important because GraphQL seeks to solve many issues and pain points of using REST.

<!-- > -->

A REST API is an API that follows REST-ful Routing. REST-ful routing is a set of conventions/specifications for manipulating a collection of data hosted on a server. 

<!-- > -->

These conventions are common rules around the type of **HTTP request** and the **URLS** that are used for reading, updating, creating or deleting data on a server.

<!-- > -->

Imagine we are working with a collection of Posts and User resources on a server. A REST-ful API might define the following routes: 

<!-- > -->

| URL | HTTP Method/Type | Operation |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| /posts | POST | ??? <!--Create new post-->|
| /posts| GET | ??? <!--Read all posts--> |
| /posts/10 | PUT | ??? <!--Update post 10--> |
| /posts/23 | DELETE | ??? <!--Delete post 23--> |
| /posts/5 | GET | ??? <!--Read post 5--> |
| /users/2/posts | POST | ??? <!--Create a post for User 2--> |

**What would be the operations for each of these routes? What do they do?**

<!-- > -->

Each route points to a url/address/endpoint <br> at the server. 

- http://yourdomain.com/posts
- http://yourdomain.com/posts 
- http://yourdomain.com/posts/10
- http://yourdomain.com/posts/23 
- http://yourdomain.com/posts/5
- http://yourdomain.com/users/2/posts

<!-- > -->

Here's a real api. 

The Star Wars API (SWAPI) uses the following routes: 

- https://swapi.dev/api/people/<id>
- https://swapi.dev/api/films/<id>
- https://swapi.dev/api/species/<id>
- https://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/<id>
- https://swapi.dev/api/starships/<id>

<!-- > -->

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL 😎 is both a query language and a specification.

The **language** allows you to _**QUERY**_ a server for data. 

The **specification** defines how the server should respond to those requests.

<!-- > -->

Unlike REST 😴 a GraphQL 😎 server would use a single ☝️ endpoint to serve all of it's resources. 

The sample API we looked used at least three routes and the Star Wars API had 5. 

<!-- > -->

If SWAPI used GraphQL 😎 <br> it would only use a single end point: 

- https://swapi.dev/api/

<!-- > -->

## GraphQL Queries 

With GraphQL you write a Query that describes the data you want.

<!-- > -->

With REST you would send a request to one of two endpoints: 

- http://yourdomain.com/posts/
- http://yourdomain.com/users/

<!-- > -->

### Try out REST 😴 with the SWAPI server.

<!-- > -->

Try the people 👯‍♀️ endpoint.

- https://swapi.dev/api/people/1 - Luke
- https://swapi.dev/api/people/3 - R2D2
- https://swapi.dev/api/people/4 - Vader
- https://swapi.dev/api/people/5 - Leia
- **Challenge: find C-3PO, Han, and Chewy**

<!-- > -->

Use the planets 🪐 endpoint.

- https://swapi.dev/api/planets/1 - Tatooine
- https://swapi.dev/api/planets/3 - Yavin VI
- https://swapi.dev/api/planets/4 - Hoth
- https://swapi.dev/api/planets/5 - Dagobah
- **Challenge: find Alderaan, Bespin, and Endor**

<!-- > -->

With GraphQL 😎 you only have a single endpoint to which you send a query that might look like this: 

```JS
{
  posts: {
    title
  }
}
```

Or this: 

```JS
{
  users: {
    name
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

### Try out GraphQL 😎 with SWAPI! 

To do this you'll use GraphiQL. It's a web page that let's you write GraphQL queries and see the results.

<!-- > -->

First, open the GraphiQL browser: 

http://graphql.org/swapi-graphql

- Type a Query in the left side
- Click the ▶️ button at the top 
- Look at the results on the right
- Try the following queries...

<!-- > -->

### Challenge: Get characters with GraphQL 😎

```JS
# Leia 
{
  person(personID: 5) {
    name
  }
}

# Challenge: Find Luke, Han, R2, C3PO and Vader
```

<!-- > -->

**Compare REST with GraphQL**

REST multiple endpoints | GraphQL single endpoint

<!-- > -->

## Over Fetching

Over fetching occurs when you make a request and receive more 🗑 data than you need. 

This happens often. Think of all of those fields that you never use. 🤔 

<!-- > -->

Look at the results that are returned with <br> the REST response vs the GraphQL response. 

**What's the difference? 🤔**

<!-- > -->

The REST API returns the following when you use the /people route:

```JS
{
	"name": "Luke Skywalker",
	"height": "172",
	"mass": "77",
	"hair_color": "blond",
	"skin_color": "fair",
	"eye_color": "blue",
	"birth_year": "19BBY",
	"gender": "male",
	"homeworld": "https://swapi.dev/api/planets/1/",
	"films": [
		"https://swapi.dev/api/films/2/",
		"https://swapi.dev/api/films/6/",
		"https://swapi.dev/api/films/3/",
		"https://swapi.dev/api/films/1/",
		"https://swapi.dev/api/films/7/"
	],
	"species": [
		"https://swapi.dev/api/species/1/"
	],
	"vehicles": [
		"https://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/14/",
		"https://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/30/"
	],
	"starships": [
		"https://swapi.dev/api/starships/12/",
		"https://swapi.dev/api/starships/22/"
	],
	"created": "2014-12-09T13:50:51.644000Z",
	"edited": "2014-12-20T21:17:56.891000Z",
	"url": "https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/"
}       
```

<!-- > -->

With GraphQL we only received: 

```JS 
{
  "data": {
    "person": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker"
    }
  }
}
```

<small>(of course we only asked for the name.)</small>

<!-- > -->

If we *only* wanted the name the GraphQL <br> query would have saved some bandwidth!

<!-- > -->

Describe the fields you want in the query: 

```JS
{
  person(personID: 4) {
    name
    eyeColor # includes eye color
  }
}

# Try these fields: height, mass
```

<!-- > -->

With GraphQL 😎 we describe what we want <br> in our query and server returns <br> 🎁 data that matches the query. 

<!-- > -->

This prevents **over fetching** where we get <br> more data than we need. 

Instead we get only the data we ask for. 

<!-- > -->

## Under Fetching 

Under fetching occurs when you don't get all of the data you need in a single request and have to make another request to get the data you require. 

<!-- > -->

### Challenge: Use https://swapi.dev to find Leia's homeworld. 🌍

- https://swapi.dev/people/5

<small>The results include a homeworld field. Use this to get the name of Leia's homeworld...</small>

<!-- > -->

### Challenge: 

1. Find Chewbacca's homeworld. 
1. Find R2-D2's homeworld
1. Find Han's homeworld

<!-- > -->

Each time you found a person, *you had to make a second request* to find their  homeworld (under fetching). 

Along the way you loaded *more* data than you needed (over-fetched.)

<!-- > -->

Try this with GraphQL. 

```JS
{
  person(personID: 4) {
    name
    homeworld {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

<small>Here in a single query we get the character's name and the name of the homeworld.</small>

<!-- > -->

### Challenge: 

1. Get R2-D2's name and homeworld
1. Get Leia's name and homeworld
1. Get Han's name, height, and homeworld
1. Get R2's name, eyecolor, homeworld and it's diamter

<!-- > -->

**Compare REST with GraphQL**

REST over or under fetches

GraphQL fetches only what you ask for

<!-- > -->

## GraphQL vs REST

**Pair and discuss the pros and cons of REST and GraphQL. **

<!-- > -->

- REST
  - Requires multiple endpoints. Makes for a complex API.
    - Harder to make changes to your API. 
  - Often over fetches providing more data that your need and eating bandwidth
  - Often under fetchs, requiring more complex queries.

<!-- > -->

- GraphQL
  - Uses a single endpoint.
    - Easier to manage
    - More tolerant to changes
  - Fetches only what you ask for
    - Prevents over fetching 
    - Prevents under fetching
    - Saves bandwidth

<!-- > -->

## Core features of GraphQL

<!-- > -->

Schema Definition Language: 
<br> syntax for writing schemas.

- **Types**
- **Introspection**

<!-- > -->

- **Resolvers**: A function on a GraphQL server that's responsible for fetching the data for a single field

<!-- > -->

Query Language

  - **Query**
  - **Mutation**

<!-- > -->

**Subscriptions**

<!-- > -->

## GraphQL Query Language

The GraphQL query language looks a lot like objects and dictionaries that you have seen in other languages. 

<!-- > -->

### GraphQL Types

<!-- > -->

Start a query with the `{` and `}`

```JS
{
  # query
}
```

<!-- > -->

You can Query any valid resource by naming it. Some resources will take parameters that describe the resource you are looking for. 

```JS
{
  person(personID: 5) {
    # ...
  }
}
```

For example using SWAPI you can query a person and include it's `personId`

Returns the resource the personId

<!-- > -->

### Introspection

GraphQL understands the features of a type and allows the system to see when we are making a mistake.

You'll see this as GraphiQL browser provides code hints. 

<!-- > -->

### Nested Types

<!-- > -->

A type might point to other types. A person for example has a homeworld which points to a planet. 

```JS
{
  person(personID: 5) {
    name
    homeworld
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

Getting the fields of a nested resource is like making query within a query. 

```JS
{
  person(personID: 3) {
    name
    homeworld {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Homeworld is another object type. With it's own fields. 

<!-- > -->

### GraphQL Collections

<!-- > -->

Collections are like arrays they properties like totalCount.

```JS
{
  allFilms{
    totalCount
  }
}
```

<small>Gets the number of films</small>

<!-- > -->

A **collection** is a collection of a type. You can get fields of that type like this: 

```JS
{
  allPeople { # All people 
    people {  # for each person
      name    # fetch their name
    }
  }
}
```

<small>Returns a list of persons.</small>

<!-- > -->

Collections allow you to get nested resources also: 

```JS
{
  allPlanets { # Get all planets
    planets {  # for each planet
      name     # Fetch the name
      filmConnection { # get the films connected to this planet
        films { # for each film
          title # fetch the title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

### Aliases 

<!-- > -->

Since the query describes the structure of what is returned sometimes you need to change the names. 

<!-- > -->

Consider a scenario where you need two people: 

```JS 
{
  person(personID:2) {
		name    
  }
  
  person(personID:3) {
    name
  }
}
```

<small>(Doesn't work!)</small>

<!-- > -->

The results have a problem

```JS
{
  "data": {
    "person": { <-- Duplicate field!
      "name": "C-3PO"
    },
    "person": { <-- Duplicate field!
      "name": "R2-D2"
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

Use an **alias** to solve the problem!

```JS 
{
  personA: person(personID:2) {
		name    
  }
  
  personB: person(personID:3) {
    name
  }
}
```

<small>(personA and personB are aliases, you could use any name for these!)</small>

<!-- > -->

The result would look like this: 

```JS
{
  "data": {
    "personA": {
      "name": "C-3PO"
    },
    "personB": {
      "name": "R2-D2"
    }
  }
}
```
