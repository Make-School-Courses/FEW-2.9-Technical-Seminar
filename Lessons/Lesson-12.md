## Object Relational Mapper

<!-- > -->

**Object Realtional Mappers** act as a middle man between your code and your database. They act as a tranalator of sorts that allows you to write the code that works with your data in the language that the rest of your app is written in. 

<!-- > -->

### Where's GraphQL? 

Since GraphQL is just a specification and a language we need a tool that implements that spec and understands the language. For this project we'll use Prisma.

<!-- > -->

## Prisma

<!-- > -->

**Prisma** is an ORM (Object-Relationship Mapper) you'll use this to connect your GraphQL resolvers to your data through your database. 

Prisma implements GraphQL. 

<!-- > -->

Prisma consists of three tools. 

- Prisma **Client** - An auto generated type safe query builder.
- Prisma **Migrate** - Declarative data model migration system
- Prisma **Studio** - A GUI to view and edit data in your database

<!-- > -->

**Prisma Client** is the code automatically generated by prisma that connects your database to your node source code. 

This code will live in your `node_modules` folder. 

<!-- > -->

**Prisma Migrate** is the system that updates your client when you make changes to your data model. 

You'll need to run a migration if you make changes to your data model that aren't reflected in your existing database. 

<!-- > -->

**Prisma Studio** is a Graphical User Interface for working with the data in your database managed by Prisma. 

<!-- > -->

Prisma integrates with many databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.  

<!-- > -->

Much like GraphQL Prisma uses a Schema to define data models and relationships.

In the tutorial you'll be defining models for Users, and Links. You'll also define a relationship: *A Link is associated with a User, and Users have a list of Links.* 

<!-- > -->

**Prisma isn't the database**. Instead it's the *Glue* that connects the database with a client. 

Client <-- --> **Prisma** <-- --> Database 

<!-- > -->

Prisma integrates with Express.js, GraphQL, Apollo and more.

<!-- > -->

All of the Prisma files you will edit live in the `prisma` folder.

The Auto generated code lives in `node_modules/prisma/prisma-client`. Since this code is auto generated you won't need to work with this directly.

<!-- > -->

What is really happening here? Prisma is looing at the schema you created and generating all of the code needed to create, update, delete, and fetch records from the database that you define. 

<!-- > -->

### Prisma Schema

The Prisma Schema describes the data model used by your GraphQL server and how it should map your database. 

<!-- > -->



<!-- > -->

#### Prisma Datasource

<!-- > -->

The datasource is the connection to the database that holds your data. 

The tutorial uses Sqlite but Prisma can work with any other database. 

We need to tell Prisma what type of database we're working with. 

<!-- > -->

#### Prisma Generator

<!-- > -->

The below generates the Prisma client code. Someone needs to write all of the code that connects Prisma with your database. 

```JS
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
``` 

<!-- > -->

The code created by the generator will live in `node_modules/prisma/prisma-client`

<!-- > -->

#### Prisma Data Model 

<!-- > -->

The Prisma Data Model defines your resources that are stored in your database. These map to the types in your GraphQL schema. 

<!-- > -->

A model should mirror your GraphQL types. 

<!-- > -->

```JS
model Link {
	// field  Type     is an id and the value is atomatically generated
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  
	// field  Type     Automatically generated
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  description String
  url         String
   // name  Type      
  postedBy    User?    @relation(fields: [postedById], references: [id])
  postedById  Int?
}
```

<!-- > -->

## Apollo Server

<!-- > -->

Apollo Server is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client.

<!-- > -->

What does that mean? Where Express is a server that supports REST Apollo-Server is a server that works with GraphQL. 

Its open source and complies with the GraphQL Spec. Remember GraphQL is a language and a spec, not a library or framework. 

<!-- > -->

You'll use Apollo-Server much the same way you would use an Express server with a few differences: 

- Has a single route/endpoint (GraphQL only needs a single endpoint)
- Handles requests with resolvers
  - Uses a schema to define queries and their types

## In Class Activity

<!-- > -->

Start working on the HowToGRaphQL tutorial.

https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/

<!-- > -->

### Prisma Notes 

<!-- > -->

Running the app with `node src/index.js` was tedious. Better to add a script to your `package.json`. 

```
	...
	"scripts": {
    ...
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  },
	...
```

Or better yet use nodemon: 

```
"start": "nodemon src/index.js"
```

<!-- > -->

As you work, be careful to note which files code apply to. Some code snippets are shown but are _not_ meant to be usesd. 

When a snippet is meant to be used, the tutorial shows the path to the file at the top in small text. keep your eye out for this. 

<!-- > -->

Sometimes there changes to a code snippet. The snippet is shown and the changes are highlighted in gray. 

<!-- > -->

As I worked through the tutorial I ran into a few issues. Here is what I saw and what I did. 

<!-- > -->

I ran into this warning while I was working: 

> warn(prisma) @prisma/cli has been renamed to prisma.
> Please uninstall @prisma/cli: npm remove @prisma/cli
> And install prisma: npm i --save-dev prisma

I ignored this. Seems like it's a version issue. I was able to get everyting working without doing this but I kept seeing the warnings. 

<!-- > -->

`src/script.js` is just for testing. It's not used for the app itself. 

You can use this as a playground of sorts to test ideas out.

<!-- > -->

I ran into a problem where my database had some bad data. It was a null value in a field that didn't allow for a null value. 

I used `src.script.js` to delete all of my records and start over again. 

```JS
await prisma.link.deleteMany({})
```

<!-- > -->

When you get to the section: *Authentication*. The tutorial will ask you to put a token in the HTTP header in the Graphiql browser. It should look like this: 

```
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjQsImlhdCI6MTYxNTkzMjczMn0.WjFt25k6eBzFv4nYwVORsSGMzmj_Jm0jnZIgflu6-jI"
}
```

Note the space after `Bearer`

The _Testing the Authentication Flow_ section of the [Authentication Chapter](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/6-authentication/) of the tutorial guides you on how to get this Authorization token and how to put it in the HTTP Header.

<!-- > -->

#### Summary of your workflow

<!-- > -->

To recap, this is the typical workflow you will follow when updating your data:

- Manually adjust your Prisma data model.
- Migrate your database using the prisma migrate CLI commands we covered.
- (Re-)generate Prisma Client
- Use Prisma Client in your application code to access your database.
